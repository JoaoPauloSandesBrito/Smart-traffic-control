# Smart-traffic-control

Jo√£o Paulo Sandes Brito

Code made for Programming Concurrent class - UESB

Developed in order to demonstrate basic knowledge in Thread (JAVA)

This code simulates city traffic, where cars have predefined routes and cannot share the same street simultaneously. They wait at intersections until the street is clear. Cars are represented as objects and use threads and semaphores to ensure that each one accesses the street exclusively, preventing concurrent access conflicts.

It uses concepts such as:
    Classes and Objects
    ArrayList
    Interface
    JavaFX
    Semaphore
    Thread
